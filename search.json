    "text": "Goals for This Presentation\n\n\n\nUnderstand Cosmological Inference: Learn how we go from observations to cosmological parameters. \nFrom χ² to Bayesian Inference: See how Bayesian modeling generalizes classical approaches. \nLearn Forward Modeling and Hierarchical Models: Understand generative models and field-level inference. \nExplore Modern Tools (JAX, NumPyro, BlackJAX): Use practical libraries for scalable inference. \nPrepare for Hands-On Notebooks: Apply Bayesian techniques in real examples using JAX.\n\n\n\n\n“Let me walk you through what we’re aiming to cover today.”\n\nFirst, we’ll build an understanding of cosmological inference — how we move from raw observational data to constraints on cosmological parameters. This includes both the intuition and the mathematical machinery behind it.\nSecond, we’ll see how Bayesian inference generalizes the classical approach. Instead of just optimizing a χ², we model uncertainty and latent structure more fully.\nThird, we’ll dive into forward modeling and hierarchical models. These are especially relevant in modern cosmology where we simulate the full data generation process and marginalize over latent variables.\nThen we’ll explore some of the modern tools that make all of this practical: JAX for fast, differentiable computing; NumPyro for probabilistic programming; and BlackJAX for flexible sampling.\nFinally, the goal is for you to leave prepared for the hands-on notebooks, where you’ll implement and explore real inference pipelines using JAX-based tools.\n\nThe goal of this is to able to start doing bayesian inference .. so if you have any questions, please ask them during the presentation."

These are hidden, unobserved quantities such as initial conditions, noise fields, or instrumental effects.\n\nThe prior encodes our belief over cosmological parameters Ω. It’s unobserved, unknown, and is the target of inference.\nThe latent variables z are also unobserved and unknown, but they are conditional on the prior — they depend on Ω and are integrated out (marginalized) during inference.\nThe likelihood is a forward model that generates observables given both the prior and latent structure: \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\text{Obs} \\mid \\Omega, z)\\)\nThe posterior combines all of these: it tells us how probable different cosmological parameters are, given the data and the model structure: \\(P(\\Omega \\mid \\text{Obs}) \\propto \\int \\mathcal{L}(\\text{Obs} \\mid \\Omega, z) \\, P(z \\mid \\Omega) \\, dz \\cdot P(\\Omega)\\)\n\nThis hierarchical view is what powers modern cosmological inference.\nSTEP 2:\nHere’s a polished version of your speaker notes for that section:\n\nWe now move to the full Bayesian formula — starting without latent variables:\nThis gives us the posterior as the product of the likelihood and the prior, normalized by the evidence. The evidence \\(P(\\text{Obs})\\) ensures the posterior is a proper probability distribution.\nNow, when we introduce latent variables \\(z\\), the likelihood itself becomes an integral over those:\nThis marginal likelihood accounts for the full hidden structure.\nIn practice, we ignore the evidence term when sampling:\n\nIt’s constant for a given model — so it doesn’t affect posterior shape.\nIt’s computationally expensive to compute (requires full integration).\nBut: it’s very useful for comparing models.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nWe sample directly from the posterior, which combines prior and likelihood.\nLatent variables model hidden or uncertain structure — like initial conditions.\nThe evidence is dropped during sampling, but becomes important in model comparison using the Bayes Factor:\n\nThis tells us which model is better supported by the data."

In Bayesian stats, they’re random variables — we assign distributions to represent our uncertainty.\nGoal: Frequentists usually aim for a point estimate (like the MLE). Bayesians aim to recover the entire posterior distribution.\nUncertainty: Frequentists focus on data variability — uncertainty from random samples. Bayesians focus on parameter uncertainty — how uncertain we are about the parameters given the data.\nIntervals: The interpretations are totally different. A frequentist says, “95% of the time, this interval contains the truth.” A Bayesian says, “There’s a 95% chance the truth is in this interval.”\nTooling: Optimization vs. sampling. Frequentists often rely on curve fitting, minimization, etc. Bayesian workflows rely on sampling (MCMC, HMC, NUTS).\n\nMake sure the audience sees this isn’t about choosing sides. As the bottom note says — they’re not mutually exclusive. A lot of modern workflows combine both perspectives.\n\n\n@image credit:Wayne Stewart"

It’s a good middle ground — cheaper than full HMC, but more efficient than MH.\nMCLMC: Stochastic Langevin dynamics with no rejection step. Useful in large latent spaces, often in simulator-based models, but biased due to lack of correction.\nAdjusted MCLMC: Same as MCLMC, but now with a Metropolis-Hastings correction step.

It gives us a way to go from simple analytic models to full simulator-based pipelines — all under one framework.\nThe JAX ecosystem — NumPyro, BlackJAX, jax-cosmo — gives you a complete toolchain. You don’t have to worry about math-heavy derivations or custom samplers. You can focus on the science and modeling.\nA major strength is the ability to leverage gradients and differentiable simulators. That means you can scale inference even for models with thousands or millions of parameters — like field-level inference.\nAnd importantly, the tools are mature and fast. These aren’t just research toys — they’re ready for real problems.\n\nNow it’s your turn. You’ll have access to two hands-on notebooks:\n\nOne walks you through Bayesian regression and cosmological inference with NumPyro.\nThe other dives into field-level inference and simulation-based modeling.\n\nThis is where things become tangible — you’ll code your own inference pipeline, simulate structure formation, and run real MCMC samplers.\nThat’s the power of combining Bayesian ideas with modern tools — and that’s where the future of cosmological inference is headed."

In fact, sometimes parallelism can make things slower due to overhead.

Unlike CPUs, which are optimized for single-threaded tasks, GPUs have thousands of threads, allowing them to process large datasets in parallel. This makes them ideal for tasks like simulations and large-scale data processing.”\n\nMassive Thread Count:\n\n“Each core in a GPU can do certain steps of the compuation.”\n\n\nNEXT\n\nMemory Throughput Bottleneck:\n\n“However, even with so many threads, the true bottleneck in GPU performance is often memory throughput. If the GPU doesn’t receive data quickly enough, even the large number of cores can’t operate at full capacity. In other words, GPUs can process a lot of data in parallel, but only if they’re fed enough data to keep all those cores busy.”\n“As you can see in the illustration, when the GPU becomes saturated, it can no longer process new data until the current batch is fully processed. This results in idle time, where the GPU isn’t doing any useful computation, even though it’s fully capable of processing more data.”\n\n\nNEXT\n\nOptimizing Throughput with Multiple GPUs:\n\n“This leads us to the concept of optimizing throughput with multiple GPUs.”\n“In many workloads, especially in cosmology and other large-scale computations, the computation is only a small portion of the total processing time. A significant amount of time is spent waiting for data, transferring it, or processing smaller chunks of data that can’t be fully parallelized.”\n“By adding more GPUs, we can increase the total data throughput, reduce idle time, and ultimately improve overall performance. With multiple GPUs working in parallel, the data is distributed more effectively, reducing bottlenecks and allowing us to handle larger and more complex datasets.”"

    "text": "Why JAX for Distributed Computing?\n\nDistributed Computing Isn’t New:\n\nTools like MPI and OpenMP are used extensively.\nML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch offer distributed training.\nDiffEqFlux.jl Horovod and Ray\n\n\n\n\nFamiliar and Accessible API:\n\nJAX offers a NumPy-like API that is both accessible and intuitive.\nPython users can leverage parallelism without needing in-depth knowledge of low-level parallel frameworks like MPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\nPythonic Scalability: JAX allows you to write scalable, pythonic code that is compiled by XLA for performance.\nAutomatic Differentiation: JAX offers a trivial way to write diffrentiable distributed code.\nSame code runs on anything from a laptop to multi node supercomputer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy am i laser focused on JAX\n\nTraditional Distributed Computing: MPI and OpenMP have been essential tools for achieving high-performance distributed computing in fields like cosmology. These frameworks provide fine control but often require specific parallel programming expertise.\nAccessibility and Familiarity: JAX’s familiar, high-level syntax lowers the barrier to entry, bringing distributed computing within reach of Python users without the need to manage intricate MPI or OpenMP settings.\nJAX’s Unique Advantages: Through XLA compilation, JAX not only scales code efficiently but also integrates differentiability, crucial for machine learning and simulations that require backpropagation. This blend of performance and flexibility sets JAX apart for scientific and AI applications.\n\nTalking Points on Alternative Framework Limitations\n\nOpen MPI: Primarily optimized for CPU-based parallelism, making it less effective on GPUs where scientific workloads in JAX often run. This can limit its efficiency for cosmology applications that leverage GPU acceleration.\nML Frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow): While powerful for machine learning, these frameworks are ML-centric and don’t natively support the arbitrary scientific functions often needed in cosmology. Customizing these frameworks for scientific use cases requires significant additional effort.\nDiffEqFlux.jl (Julia): While Julia’s ecosystem is growing, it’s still limited compared to Python, particularly for scientific computing and distributed applications. This smaller ecosystem can make it harder to find compatible tools and libraries for complex cosmological simulations.\nHorovod and Ray: Neither is natively differentiable, which means they rely on external frameworks (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) for differentiation. This lack of built-in differentiability adds overhead and complexity for workflows that require gradient-based optimization, a key feature that JAX integrates seamlessly.\n\nFor questions\nPyTorch Distributed\n\nComplex Setup: Requires more effort to configure distributed training, especially outside deep learning.\nPerformance Overhead: Lacks JAX’s XLA compilation, which can lead to inefficiencies in scientific applications.\nLimited Scientific Libraries: PyTorch’s ecosystem is growing, but it still lacks the depth of JAX for scientific and physics-based computing.\n\nTensorFlow Distributed\n\nComplex and Verbose: Distributed setup with tf.distribute.Strategy is often more cumbersome and requires multiple API layers.\nLess Flexibility with Gradients: Limited flexibility in complex gradient computations compared to JAX’s functional approach.\nUnder-Optimized for Scientific Workflows: XLA support is not as performant in scientific HPC compared to JAX.\n\nRay with Auto-Differentiation\n\nNot Natively Differentiable: Ray relies on external libraries (like PyTorch and TensorFlow) for differentiation, adding communication and synchronization overhead.\nFocus on General Purpose Computing: Lacks specific optimizations for HPC environments and scientific computing.\nLimited Low-Level Hardware Control: Ray abstracts device management, reducing optimization potential in specialized HPC setups.\n\nDiffEqFlux.jl (Julia)\n\nLimited Ecosystem: Julia’s ecosystem is smaller and less mature, especially for scientific computing.\nDeveloping Distributed Support: Distributed computing in Julia is still evolving and less robust than in Python.\nLearning Curve: Julia has a steeper learning curve for Python-based teams, and integration with Python infrastructure can be difficult.\n\nMesh TensorFlow\n\nSpecialized for Transformers: Primarily designed for partitioning large transformer models, limiting flexibility in other scientific applications.\nComplex Configuration: Mesh configuration is often challenging and may be a barrier for scientific users.\nTied to TensorFlow: Mesh TensorFlow’s dependency on TensorFlow makes it less intuitive for scientific computing compared to JAX’s NumPy-like API.\n\nHorovod (Multi-Framework)\n\nOptimized for Data Parallelism in ML: Primarily suited for data parallelism in ML, not as adaptable for complex scientific workflows.\nExternal Library Dependence: Requires frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow for auto-differentiation, adding performance overhead.\nLimited Scientific Integration: Does not integrate well with libraries focused on physical simulations, whereas JAX has a growing ecosystem for such applications.\n\nKey Advantages of JAX\n\nUnified, Pythonic API: JAX’s intuitive API combines ease of use with the power of distributed computing.\nXLA Compilation for Efficiency: Optimized for performance across devices, making it highly suitable for HPC environments.\nNative Differentiability: Differentiability is built-in and seamlessly integrated with distributed workflows, providing a smooth experience for scientific applications."

On peut voir que la résolution plus élevée permet de capturer plus de détails dans le champ de densité.\nNEXT\nSi on visualise le spectre de puissance de ces deux champs, on peut voir que la résolution plus basse sous-estime la densité de matière et les interactions à petite échelle. En fonction du type du but cosmologique , ce qui peut dire que ce type d’inference ne sera pas capable de mettre une contrainte mielleure voir meme pire par rapport à une méthode basé sur des fonction de correlation à deux points ou spectre de puissance.\nLa taille de mémoire etant un facteur limitant, il est important de pouvoir mettre à l’échelle ces simulations sur plusieurs GPU et nœuds de calcul haute performance.\nLe passage à une simulation multi-GPU nécessite des opérations de FFT distribuées, des interpolations distribuées et des conditions aux limites.\nNEXT\nNotre but serait de pouvoir faires simulation qui peuvent être distribuées sur plusieur GPU et nœuds de calcul haute performance. Tout en restant diffirentiable et rapide (quelque secondes pour chaque simulation).\npas été fait"

On obtient donc des gradients.\nNEXT\nEnsuite on interpole les forces sur les particules pour les mettre à jour.\nChaque gradient contribue au deplacement d’une particule en fonction de sa distance à la cellule.\nNEXT\nCependant, cette méthode n’est pas compatible avec les simulations distribuées, car elle nécessite de lire les valeurs des cellules voisines, ce qui n’est pas possible si les cellules sont sur un autre GPU. Ce qui se passe sur un seul GPU c’est l’application de la condition periodique. Ce qui veut dire que les particules qui sort d’un sous domain reviennent de l’autre coté du meme domaine.\nCela le reflète pas la réalité physique, et peut introduire des erreurs dans les simulations.\nNEXT\nJe montre dans le slide suivant quel impact cela peut avoir sur les simulations."
